##  API Client Goals

* Make API easy to use from Ruby
* Take care of complicated details...
* But, don't hide powerful API features
* Objects are better than Hashes parsed from JSON
* Simple design - easy to extend and support

note:
    * complicated details --> authorization and pagination
    * powerful API features --> customizable repsonses and formats
    * you want pull requests
